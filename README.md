# YFNW_Quest2_V0142
First VR prototype of Your Friendly Neighborhood Witch project
In this project, I have extended the previous version of the YFNW game prototype. In the previous version the character was controlled using mouse and keyboard and interactions were based on raycast or trigger colliders. On this occasion, I have mostly utilized the XR Simple and Grab Interactors and teleporters. The character tries to move around the maze to solve several different puzzles and take down the hostile NPCs. The character traverses using the teleportation wand in the left hand. The right hand can be used to interact with objects, hold the Scorch Wand, the Shield, or the Heart. When the heart is placed inside the final boss, it serves as a key to a lock and opens the door to the next level. When the player touches the door to the next level the magic shop is loaded. The character can interact very basically with the materials inside the magic shop for this iteration as well.
